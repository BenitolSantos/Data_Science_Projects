    "## Project description\n",
    "    We are trying to find which factors influence someone not leaving telecom (not having an end date).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    You have access to behavior data about users based on their contract, personal, internet and phone data. For this classification task, you need to develop a model that will predict whether or not a user will have an end date.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Develop a model with the highest possible accuracy. Check the accuracy using the test dataset. In this project, the threshold for accuracy is 0.75, but an 0.88 or greater is best. Pick the Best Model based on the AUC-ROC score.\n",
    "## Project Instructions\n",
    "### Step 1. Open the data file and study the general information\n",
    "#### File path:\n",
    "    /final_provider/contract.csv\n",
    "    /final_provider/internet.csv\n",
    "    /final_provider/personal.csv\n",
    "    /final_provider/phone.csv\n",
    "### Step 2. Prepare the data\n",
    "    Convert the data to the necessary types\n",
    "    Find and eliminate errors in the data\n",
    "    Explain what errors you found and how you removed them.\n",
    "    Make sure the data is balanced.\n",
    "    Remember to include customers who have only picked only plans (Don't delete customers NaNs in other plans, just encode a column for them\n",
    "    Encode the data.\n",
    "    Careful with data leakage, make sure to not include features that may be collinear (i.e if using one-hot encoding for categorical variables, drop one of the columns) or reference the target variable in some way (see topic on data leakage)\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Step 3. Analyze the data\n",
    "    Describe the customers' behavior. \n",
    "    Calculate the mean, variance, and standard deviation. \n",
    "    Plot histograms. \n",
    "    Describe the distributions.\n",
    "    If possible, explain the correlation between certain features.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Step 4. Split the source data into a training set, a validation set, and a test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5. Investigate the quality of different models by changing hyperparameters on the validation set  preferably using: Dummy Model, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Neural Network. Briefly describe the findings of the study \n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6. Check the quality of the model using the test set. Incase of an class imbalance in the data, make sure you upsample or SMOTE\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7. Additional task: sanity check the model. This data is more complex than what youâ€™re used to working with, so it's not an easy task. We'll take a closer look at it later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 8. Examine the balance of classes. Train the model without taking into account the imbalance. Briefly describe your findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 9. Improve the quality of the model. Make sure you use at least two approaches to fixing class imbalance. Use the test set to pick the best parameters. Train different models on training and validation sets. Find the best one. Briefly describe your findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 10.  Perform the final testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 11. Report your conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
