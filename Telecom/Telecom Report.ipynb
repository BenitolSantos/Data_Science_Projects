    "    This is definitely a classification task. Meaning. 4 files opened with no problems, NaNs or duplicates with each file so far. CustomerID, BeginDate, MonthlyCharges and TotalCharges are not needed. No nans, definitely needs a merge though. NaNs only showed up post merge.'No's replaced post merge NaN's. Final merged graph needed to be encoded pre model training. Then a relabel and resize of column names. Statistical analysis didn't matter on Monthly and Total charges due to them being dropped.\n",

    "    Logistic Regression was the highest score of 0.8450305143853531 compared to the rest of the models, even unbalanced. The features and target were set up with a train split of 8/2.\n",
    "### Balanced\n",
    "    With the data being unbalanced, the best two balancing were upscaling and class_weight='balanced'.\n",

    "    Using Logistic Regression, upscaling, and class_weight='balanced', was proven the highest score compared to using downscaling and unbalanced.\n",

    "    Final AUC-ROC score was 0.8117814928756477, using Logistic Regression, upscaling, and class_weight='balanced'. "
