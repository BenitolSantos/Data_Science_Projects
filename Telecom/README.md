I am trying to find which factors influence someone not leaving telecom (not having an end date).

You have access to behavior data about users based on their contract, personal, internet and phone data. For this classification task, you need to develop a model that will predict whether or not a user will have an end date.

Develop a model with the highest possible accuracy. Check the accuracy using the test dataset. In this project, the threshold for accuracy is 0.75, but an 0.88 or greater is best. Pick the Best Model based on the AUC-ROC score.
