It's time to deal with a real data science problem from the gold mining sector. My project is provided by Zyfra. When you finish, send your work to the project reviewer. My will receive feedback within 24 hours. After that, you will make any necessary changes to your work and send it for a second review. Usually, this process has to be repeated several times until you get the green light from the reviewer and all the corrections are approved. Thatâ€™s all part of the job. My project will be considered complete once the project reviewer approves it.
