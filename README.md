# Data Analyst and Data Scientist professional program


These projects were completed for Practicum's Data Analyst / Data Scientist professional training programs.

| Project name | Description |
| :---------------------- | :---------------------- |
| Big City Music | Comparing the music preferences of the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville. Looking at data to test the hypotheses below and compare user behavior for these two cities.| 
| Credit Scoring | Prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. Find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children have an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness.| 
| Crankshaft | Hundreds of free advertisements for vehicles are published on your site every day. Study data collected over the last few years and determine which factors influence the price of a vehicle.
| Megaline | The company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget.
| Ice | Identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This will allow you to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns. In front of you is data going back to 2016. 
| Zuber | Find patterns for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company that's launching in Chicago. You want to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides.
| Megaline Machine Learning | Access behavior data about subscribers who have already switched to the new plans (from the Megaline project). Develop a classification model that will pick the right plan.
| Beta Bank | Predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon, with the data on clients’ past behavior and termination of contracts with the bank. Build a model with the maximum possible F1 score. Additionally, measure the AUC-ROC metric and compare it with the F1.
| OilyGiant | Collect the oil well parameters in the selected region: oil quality and volume of reserves; Build a model for predicting the volume of reserves in the new wells; Pick the oil wells with the highest estimated values; Pick the region with the highest total profit for the selected oil wells.
| Zyfra | Prepare a prototype of a machine learning model for Zyfra from Zyfra.com. Develop a efficiency solution for heavy industry. Predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore. You have the data on extraction and purification. Optimize the production and eliminate unprofitable parameters.
| Sure Tomorrow insurance | Find customers who are similar to a given customer. Help the company's agents with marketing. Predict whether a new customer is likely to receive an insurance benefit. Predict the number of insurance benefits a new customer is likely to receive using a linear regression model. Protect clients' personal data.
| Rusty Bargain | Quickly find out the market value of your car. You have access to historical data: technical specifications, trim versions, and prices. Build the model to determine the value.
| Sweet Lift Taxi | We need to predict the amount of taxi orders for the next hour to attract more drivers during peak hours. Build a model for such a prediction.
| Film Junky Union | Train a model to automatically detect negative reviews. You'll be using a dataset of IMBD movie reviews with polarity labelling to build a model for classifying positive and negative reviews.
| Good Seed | Explore if Computer vision methods can be used to determine age of a person from a photo and whether Data Science can help them adhere to alcohol laws by making sure they do not sell alcohol to people underage.
