Develop a classification model that will pick the right plan. |*pandas, sklearn*|
|[Beta Bank](https://github.com/BenitolSantos/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/Beta%20Bank "Beta Bank") | Predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon, with the data on clients’ past behavior and termination of contracts with the bank. Build a model with the maximum possible F1 score. Additionally, measure the AUC-ROC metric and compare it with the F1. |*pandas, sklearn*|
|[OilyGiant](https://github.com/BenitolSantos/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/OilyGiant "OilyGiant")| Collect the oil well parameters in the selected region: oil quality and volume of reserves; Build a model for predicting the volume of reserves in the new wells; Pick the oil wells with the highest estimated values; Pick the region with the highest total profit for the selected oil wells. |*pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn*|
|[Zyfra](https://github.com/BenitolSantos/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/Zyfra "Zyfra")| Prepare a prototype of a machine learning model for Zyfra from Zyfra.com. Develop a efficiency solution for heavy industry. Predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore. You have the data on extraction and purification. Optimize the production and eliminate unprofitable parameters. |*pandas, matplotlib, numpy, sklearn*|
|[Sure Tomorrow insurance](https://github.com/BenitolSantos/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/Sure%20Tomorrow%20insurance "Sure Tomorrow insurance") | Find customers who are similar to a given customer. Help the company's agents with marketing. Predict whether a new customer is likely to receive an insurance benefit. Predict the number of insurance benefits a new customer is likely to receive using a linear regression model. Protect clients' personal data. |*pandas, numpy, seaborn, sklearn*|
|[Rusty Bargain](https://github.com/BenitolSantos/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/Rusty%20Bargain "Rusty Bargain") | Quickly find out the market value of your car. You have access to historical data: technical specifications, trim versions, and prices. Build the model to determine the value. |*pandas, numpy, sklearn, time, catboost, lightgbm*|
|[Sweet Lift Taxi](https://github.com/BenitolSantos/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/Sweet%20Lift%20Taxi "Sweet Lift Taxi") | We need to predict the amount of taxi orders for the next hour to attract more drivers during peak hours. Build a model for such a prediction.| *pandas, matplotlib, scipy, numpy, nltk*|
|[Film Junky Union](https://github.com/BenitolSantos/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/Film%20Junky%20Union "Film Junky Union") | Train a model to automatically detect negative reviews. You'll be using a dataset of IMBD movie reviews with polarity labelling to build a model for classifying positive and negative reviews. |*pandas, numpy, math, re, nltk, matplotlib, seaborn, tqdm*|
|[Good Seed](https://github.com/BenitolSantos/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/Good%20Seed "Good Seed") | Explore if Computer vision methods can be used to determine age of a person from a photo and whether Data Science can help them adhere to alcohol laws by making sure they do not sell alcohol to people underage. |*pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, tensorflow*|
