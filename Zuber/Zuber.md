I'm working as an analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company that's launching in Chicago. My task is to find patterns in the available information. You want to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides. Working with a database, I'll analyze data from competitors and test a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency.
